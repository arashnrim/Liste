## Introduction
Welcome to **Listé**, the simplified and open-sourced productive to-do list app for everyone.

Whether you're a beginner app developer or an innovator using the app, we'd love adding on the number of users in this project. We plan to cater to all; however, we're only focusing on developing the app in this current point in time. If you're a developer and wish to contribute, check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below.

For designers, stay tuned for details coming soon!

## Getting Started
We're glad that you'd like to contribute to our project. To begin, check out our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to see what you have to do, including structuring your commit message and general rules-of-thumb that we recommended you to follow.

## Support
If you need help with anything related to the project, we recommend opening a new issue in the Issue Tracker page. Following GitHub's [Open Source Guide](https://www.opensource.guide), we strongly advise against privately communicating.

## What's Ahead
Listé is an existing project, and henceforth a version 1.0 (latest 1.0.3) exists. While the App Store contains the app, the app is currently unusable at this point as we're rewriting the code. Here's what we plan for the next few versions, starting from version 1.1.0:

Listé 1.1.0
- Reintroduced user interface. We've taken the design of version 1.0 and redesigned the interface completely, making the app more usable and available to more features.

Listé 1.2.0
- Collaborative Lists. A simple, innovative way to share a List with people.
- Local storage. Version 1.0 emphasizes a mostly online structure, unnecessarily using data to sync with the online database (Firebase). In the new version, we're only making Collaborative Lists (a new feature) store data online; everything else uses UserDefaults or other forms of local storage.
